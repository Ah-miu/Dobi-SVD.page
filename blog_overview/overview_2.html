        After continuously selecting, we use differentiable techniques to find the best truncation position. 
        This is a very natural idea, but previous works haven't done this because they couldn't solve this issue:<br><br>

        Since lots of singular values in the low-rank matrix are of similar size, and during SVD backpropagation, 
        there's an operator: $\frac{1}{\sigma_i - \sigma_j}$, one divided by the difference of singular i and singular j, 
        which can lead to gradient explosion.<br><br>

        We then use the Taylor Expansion to change the subtraction into a division form.<br><br>
        
        This is not a common method for handling gradient explosion. Besides our work, we found only one paper<sup>1</sup>, 
        which also addresses the backpropagation issue of SVD, and it focuses on lower-dimensional symmetric matrices and CV tasks, 
        whereas we are dealing with higher-dimensional general matrices and applying it on large models. 
        If you're interested in the impact of the Taylor Expansion on gradients, you can refer to that paper.
