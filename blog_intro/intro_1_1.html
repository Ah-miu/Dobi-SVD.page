        SVD stands for Singular Value Decomposition (not Stable Video Diffusion). When we perform SVD on a matrix <i>W</i>, 
        we obtain three matrices: <i>U</i>, <i>S</i>, and <i>V</i>.
        <li>Singular value indicates the degree of stretching or compression of the matrix transformation, 
        affecting the size of the input vector projection in the output space.</li>
        <li>Left singular vector Represents the important direction in the input space (or original space).</li>
        <li>Right singular vector Represents the important direction in the output space (or transformed space.</li>

        LLM weight matrices present long-tailed shape, which means that they are low rank. VLM, VAR, VLA also have this kind of feature.

        After pre-training, the singular values of the weight matrix form a long-tailed shape, 
        like the delta of a Coastal Plain Estuary<sup>[1]</sup>. To put it more vividly, it's the <strong>information 
        flush</strong><sup>[2]</sup> that changed the weights. And what kind of information is this?<br><br>

        It's like when we first learn a language &#0151; we focus on high-frequency words and 
        expressions because they help us use the language effectively.<br><br>
        
        Similarly, after pre-training, the singular values show us which features are 
        important for the model to finish tasks. Generally, the larger the singular value, 
        the greater its impact on task performance.
