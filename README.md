## Dobi-Style Website

**Dobi-Style**: "picture/text + **icon** + blog window/web action" â€“ a more efficient and flexible way to present your research results.

- **Efficient**: Displaying comprehensive and rich information with minimal space, where all the key points could be front and center. Additionally, the web code is simple and clean, allowing you to focus on perfecting the presentation.
- **Flexible**: Place the icons wherever you want, explaining or sharing something one by one. Different readers have different interests, so they can click on whatever catches their attention.
